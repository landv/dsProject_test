year, for $290,600 arising from a dispute with the owner over design and specification changes in
a building currently under construction. The changes were made at the request of the owner to
improve the thermal characteristics of the building and, in the opinion of counsel, gave rise to a
valid claim against the owner.
The retained and unbilled contracts receivable at December 31, 20X2, included $38,600 that was
not expected to be collected within one year.
Contracts receivable include approximately $800,000 due under one contract.
