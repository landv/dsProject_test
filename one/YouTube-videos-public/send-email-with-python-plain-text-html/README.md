Welcome to your How to Send Emails with Python tutorial. You'll use Python to send Emails of Plain text, HTML with attachments through Gmail.

We can easily automate the process of sending emails using Python. It’s handy when you are sending similar content over and over again. This automation could reduce human errors and free your time as well!

For example, if you need to update a list of contacts based on new daily data, you can use Python to create a new report and share it with them by sending emails. Or, if you have a Python program that takes a long time to run, you can ask Python to send you a reminder email when it’s done.

Example 1: Send your first Plain Text email

Example 2: Add multiple recipients, Subject, To

Example 3: Send HTML content Emails

Example 4: Add attachments
