This repo saves code for the Handling Imbalanced Data series for our YouTube channel. Please check out the videos for detailed explanations. (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2L4c5jChmctqiXvOaJA91o0OJhYq1rR9).

Welcome to our Handling Imbalanced Data in machine learning classification series. You'll work on a highly imbalanced example dataset in Python.

In this Part 1 video,  we'll learn:
- what is imbalanced data
- what are the proper evaluation metrics for it
- set up our example of a highly imbalanced dataset ready for modeling. 

GitHub Repo with code: https://github.com/liannewriting/YouTube-videos-public/tree/main/imbalanced-data-machine-learning-abalone19

Source of the dataset: https://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/dataset.php?cod=115 Please download from GitHub, since we've made minor changes to the original dataset.

Please check out the Part 2 video to learn 6 popular techniques to deal with the imbalanced data problem in Python.

✔️Collecting a bigger sample

✔️Oversampling (e.g., random, SMOTE)

✔️Undersampling (e.g., random, K-Means, Tomek links)

✔️Combining over and undersampling

✔️Weighing classes differently

✔️Changing algorithms


Technologies that will be used:
☑️ JupyterLab (Notebook)
☑️ pandas
☑️ sklearn
☑️ imbalanced-learn (imblearn)
